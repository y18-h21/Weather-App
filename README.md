 Weather-App
 
## Description:
This is a simple yet powerful command-line weather application built using Python. It allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for any location worldwide by integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API. The app provides essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short weather description.

This project is an excellent starting point for beginners looking to learn API integration, HTTP requests, and JSON parsing in Python.

## Features:
-> Real-time Weather Data: Fetches up-to-date weather conditions for any city.
-> Temperature Display: Shows the current temperature in Celsius.
-> Humidity Information: Displays the humidity percentage.
-> Wind Speed Tracking: Provides wind speed in meters per second.
-> Weather Description: Gives a short description of the weather (e.g., "clear sky," "light rain").
-> API Integration: Uses the OpenWeatherMap API for reliable data retrieval.
-> Lightweight & Fast: No heavy dependenciesâ€”just install requests and start using it.

## How It Works:
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed and install the requests library:
pip install requests
Get an API Key:
Sign up at OpenWeatherMap
Generate a free API key

## Run the Script:
python weather.py
Enter a Location:
Input the city and country (e.g., New York, US)
Get the real-time weather details displayed in the terminal

## Tech Stack:
